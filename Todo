*************************** Mandatory ************************

• Display prompt when waiting for a new command +++DONE+++

• Have a working history +++DONE+++

• Search and launch the right exec (PATH or relative/absolute) +++DONE+++
see pipex my friend +++DONE+++

• Use at most one global variable to indicate a received
signal

• Not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters which
are not required by the subject such as \ or ;

• Handle single quote -> prevent shell from interpreting the
metacharacters in the quoted sequence.

• Handle double quotes -> prevents shell from interpreting the
metacharacters in the quoted sequence except for $.

• Implement the following redirections :
	◦ < should redirect an input.
	◦ > should redirect output
	◦ << should be given a delimiter, then read the input
	until a line containing the delimiter is seen.
	However, it doesn't have to update the history !
	◦ >> should redirect output in append mode.

• Implement pipes. The output of each command in the pipelines
is connected to the input of the next command via a pipe.

• Handle environment variables ($****) which should expand to
their values.

• Handle $? which should expand to the exit status of the most
recently executed foreground pipeline.

• Handle ctrl + C, ctrl + D and ctrl + \ which should behave
like in bash. +++DONE+++

• In interactive mode:
	◦ ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
	◦ ctrl-D exits the shell.
	◦ ctrl-\ does nothing.

• Your shell must implement the following built-in commands:
	◦ echo with option -n +++DONE+++
	◦ cd with only a relative or absolute path
	◦ pwd with no options +++DONE+++ (I THINK ??)
	◦ export with no options
	◦ unset with no options
	◦ env with no options or arguments
	◦ exit with no options +++DONE+++
